# Junior Frontend Developer Challenge - travel audience

## Task
The goal is to build an HTML5 application which serves as a countdown timer. The web-page should have the option to start preset timers as well as to start a custom timer:

**Preset timers** -
The page should have 3 buttons that start a timer for 5, 15 or 30 minutes.

**Custom Timers** -
There should be an option for the user to enter the number of minutes to start the timer for. The maximum limit for the timer should be the number of seconds in a day.

When the timer is started, the countdown to 0 should start in HH:MM:SS or in MM:SS format depending on the input. The countdown should be accompanied with a simple animation- could be a loading bar, a circle which fills up gradually - the exact design is left upto you.

The web application should also show the time at which the timer is going to end. For example, if the current time is 10:00, and the user starts a timer for 5 minutes, then the web-page should show that the timer will end at 10:05.

When the timer ends, the user should be given the following two options:

**Set Another Timer** - To start another timer.

**Close** - To close the application.


## Design Instructions
The look of the web-page is left entirely to you. It should reflect your design and aesthetic sense but also be user friendly. The website should be completely responsive, and any change in the screen size should not affect the UI or the functionality.

## Development Instructions
1. Only vanilla Javascript should be used. Please refrain from using jQuery or any other JS libraries.
2. Please build the UI using vanilla CSS (no Bootstrap). You can also use CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS, but it is not mandatory.
3. If you need to explain some design decisions, please include relevant comments in your code. Keep the code readable and tidy.
4. The application should be published using GitHub Pages. Please include your Github repository for the challenge and the URL to your web-page with the solution.
